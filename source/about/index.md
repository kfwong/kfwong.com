I'm currently working as a software consultant at [ThoughtWorks Singapore](https://www.thoughtworks.com/). I care about engineering practices and how I can help culivate more quality engineers within the IT community. You can find me doing archery or playing boardgames when I'm not coding. Slowing picking up urban sketching skills too!
